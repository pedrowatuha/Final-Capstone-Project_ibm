# Final-Capstone-Project_ibm
This repository consists in the course capstone for IBM Data Science Course on Coursera.
There are 4 different works in it:
  1. A clustering file for Canada venues close to a determined county found in wikipedia
  2. A regression using data acquired by the foursquared API, acquiring the overall impact that the number of venues close to a house have in the price.
  3. A document discussing a little about the answers gathered.
  4. A presentation to expose the findings.
